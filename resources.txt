Prompts given to ChatGPT for content:

I am creating a mock website for a veterinary clinic whose name is Akira Vet. It has 4 pages: Home, About Us, Our Services, and Contact Us.
Write 2 paragraphs of about 70 words each for the home page.
On the second page, About Us, there are 3 sections: Get to Know Us, which is an intro, Our Team, and Our Facilities. Write a paragraph for each, the first one of about 50 words, and the others of about 70. 
For the third page, Our Services, write an intro of about 60 words, and a description of less than 20 words for each of the following services:
Routine Checks, Vaccination, Surgery, Grooming, Pet Daycare, and Pet Store.
On the home page, two icons allow you to navigate to other parts of the website: Our Services, and Book an Appointment. Write A description of no more than 20 words for each.
